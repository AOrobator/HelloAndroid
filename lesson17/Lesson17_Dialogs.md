# Lesson 17: Dialogs

A dialog is a small window that prompts the user to make a decision or enter additional information.
A dialog does not fill the screen and is normally used for modal events that require users to take 
an action before they can proceed.

Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, 
dismissed, or a required action has been taken.

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

### Confirmation Dialog

Confirmation dialogs require users to confirm a choice before the dialog is dismissed.

### Full-screen Dialog

Full-screen dialogs fill the entire screen, containing actions that require a series of tasks to 
complete.
