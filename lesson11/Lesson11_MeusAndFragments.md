# Lesson 11: Menus and Fragments

In this lesson, we'll continue working on our StackOverflow client as we cover the topics of menus 
and Fragments. The options menu is the primary collection of menu items for an activity. It's where 
you should place actions that have a global impact on the app, such as "Search," "Compose email," 
and "Settings." Here's an example of Gmail's Options Menu:

![Options Menu][options_menu]

In our StackOverflow Client, we'll create an options menu in `QuestionsActivity` that will take us 
to `FragmentActivity`. In `FragmentActivity` we'll learn about `Fragments`, which are reusable view 
components very similar to Activities.
