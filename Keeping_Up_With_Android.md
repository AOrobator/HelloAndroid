# Keeping up with Android

Watch conferences/Go to Meetups/Watch Videos
 * There’s a ton of great content online, and not just for/about Android. I recommend finding 
   recorded conference talks and watching them in your spare time. Most Droidcon videos would be a 
   good place to start. I’ll start you off with a non-Android example though so you get what I mean.
   Throughout the industry (Android, iOS, Backend), you’ll begin to see common patterns emerge and 
   you can end up learning a lot from someone who isn’t directly in your field. Sandi Metz is a 
   great example. You can learn a ton from her videos: https://youtu.be/8bZh5LMaSmE

 * The Android Developer’s YouTube channel is a gold mine: https://www.youtube.com/user/androiddevelopers
 * Android Meetups are a great place to meet fellow Android developers, network, and exchange new 
   ideas: https://www.meetup.com/

Read code!
Professional developers aren’t afraid to dive into code they didn’t write so they can figure out how
everything works. I’d recommend reading open source libraries like Picasso or Dagger or even the 
support library. There are also many open source Android examples on Github. By reading other 
people’s code, you’ll learn of new ways to solve problems, better ways to organize your code, etc. 
Not every project out there has “good” code though, so read everything with a grain of salt. I’d 
recommend checking out open source libraries by Square to start. https://github.com/square Skimming through Jake Wharton’s Github profile wouldn’t be a bad idea either. https://github.com/JakeWharton?tab=repositories
