# Lesson 11 Lab: Menus

In this lab, we'll be creating a menu with different items and responding to click events 
appropriately.

The first thing we'll want to do is create our menu xml resource file. Create a folder with the path
`main/res/menu`. Once this folder is created, select it and press Command + N. You should see the 
following menu appear:

![new_menu]

Select Menu resource file from this menu and choose lab_menu as a name. Typing "menu" will select 
the option faster than using your mouse. A menu xml resource file will be created for you with 
enclosing menu tags. 

Create a menu item with the following attributes:

```xml
<item
  android:id="@+id/option_archive"
  android:icon="@drawable/ic_archive_24dp"
  android:title="Archive"
  app:showAsAction="ifRoom"/>
```

You'll have to create the icon yourself using the Vector Asset Studio. Select the `drawable` folder 
and press Command + N to open up the "New Menu". Type "vector" and select Vector Asset. Once there,
you should see the following window:

![create_vector_asset]

First click on the clip art to change the icon. You'll want to search for "Archive". Next change the 
icon color to white. Then rename the icon to "ic_archive_24dp".

After this we'll create a second menu item that will only be shown in the overflow menu.
