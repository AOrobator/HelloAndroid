# Lesson 18: Paging

Paging data is an efficient way of incrementally loading data from large collections into a limited 
amount of memory. Many APIs only return paged results for large collections to keep response sizes 
small and limit the memory usage of a server. In addition to being used for network requests, one 
might also implement paging for database queries of large collections. Google provides the 
[Paging library] for conveniently implementing paging. In this lesson, we'll work through Google's 
[Paging Codelab] to learn how to use it.

## 1. Introduction

### What you'll build
In this codelab, you start with a sample app that already displays a list of GitHub repositories, 
loading data from the database and that is backed by network data. Whenever the user scrolls and 
gets to the end of the displayed list, a new network request is triggered and its result is saved in
the database.

You will add code through a series of steps, integrating the Paging library components as you 
progress. These components are described in Step 2.


## 2. Paging library components

The Paging Library makes it easier for you to load data gradually and gracefully within your app's 
UI.

The [Guide to App Architecture] proposes an architecture with the following main components:

 * A local database that serves as a single source of truth for data presented to the user and the 
   actions the user has taken to change that data.
 * A web API service
 * A repository that works with the database and the API service, providing a unified data interface
 * A ViewModel that provides data specific for the UI
 * The UI, which shows a visual representation of the data in the ViewModel
 
The Paging library works with all of these components and coordinates the interactions between them,
so that it can page content from a data source and display that content in the UI.

![paging_library_overview]

This codelab introduces you to the Paging library and its main components:

 * [PagedList] - a collection that loads data in pages, asynchronously. A `PagedList` can be used to
   load data from sources you define, and present it easily in your UI with a `RecyclerView`.
 * [DataSource] and [DataSource.Factory] - a `DataSource` is the base class for loading snapshots of 
   data into a `PagedList`. A `DataSource.Factory` is responsible for creating a `DataSource`.
 * [LivePagedListBuilder] - builds a `LiveData<PagedList>`, based on `DataSource.Factory` and a 
   [PagedList.Config].
 * [BoundaryCallback] - signals when a `PagedList` has reached the end of available data.
 * [PagedListAdapter] - a `RecyclerView.Adapter` that presents paged data from `PagedLists` in a 
   `RecyclerView`. `PagedListAdapter` listens to `PagedList` loading callbacks as pages are loaded, 
   and uses [DiffUtil] to compute fine grained updates as new `PagedLists` are received.

In this codelab, you implement examples of each of the components described above.

## 3. Project overview

![github_app]

The app allows you to search GitHub for repositories whose name or description contains a specific 
word. The list of repositories is displayed, in descending order based on the number of stars, then 
by the name. The database is the source of truth for data that is displayed by the UI, and it's 
backed by network requests.

The list of repositories, by name, is retrieved via a `LiveData` object in `RepoDao.reposByName`. 
Whenever new data from the network is inserted into the database, the `LiveData` will emit again with 
the entire result of the query.

The current implementation has two memory/performance issues:

 * The entire **repo** table of the database is loaded at once.
 * The entire list of results from the database is kept in memory.
 
The app follows the architecture recommended in the "Guide to App Architecture", using Room as local
data storage. Here's what you will find in each package:

 * **api** - contains Github API calls, using Retrofit
 * **db** - database cache for network data
 * **data** - contains the repository class, responsible for triggering API requests and saving the 
   response in the database
 * **ui** - contains classes related to displaying an `Activity` with a `RecyclerView`
 * **model** - contains the `Repo` data model, which is also a table in the Room database; and 
   `RepoSearchResult`, a class that is used by the UI to observe both search results data and network errors

__Caution: The `GithubRepository` and `Repo` classes have similar names but serve very different 
purposes.The repository class, `GithubRepository`, works with `Repo` data objects that represent 
GitHub code repositories.__

## 4. Load data in chunks with the PagedList

In our current implementation, we use a `LiveData<List<Repo>>` to get the data from the database and
pass it to the UI. Whenever the data from the local database is modified, the `LiveData` emits an 
updated list. The alternative to `List<Repo>` is a `PagedList<Repo>`. A [PagedList] is a version of 
a List that loads content in chunks. Similar to the List, the `PagedList` holds a snapshot of 
content, so updates occur when new instances of `PagedList` are delivered via `LiveData`.

When a `PagedList` is created, it immediately loads the first chunk of data and expands over time as 
content is loaded in future passes. The size of the `PagedList` is the number of items loaded during
each pass. The class supports both infinite lists and very large lists with a fixed number of 
elements.

**Replace occurrences of `List<Repo>` with `PagedList<Repo>`:**

 * `RepoSearchResult` is the data model that's used by the UI to display data. Since the data is no 
   longer a `LiveData<List<Repo>>` but is paginated, it needs to be replaced with 
   `LiveData<PagedList<Repo>>`. Make this change in the `RepoSearchResult` class.

 * `SearchRepositoriesViewModel` works with the data from the `GithubRepository`. Change the type of 
   the repos val exposed by the `ViewModel`, from `LiveData<List<Repo>>` to 
   `LiveData<PagedList<Repo>>`. 
   
 * `SearchRepositoriesActivity` observes the repos from the `ViewModel`.
  
Change the type of the observer from `List<Repo>` to `PagedList<Repo>`.

```java
viewModel.repos.observe(this, (PagedList<Repo> repos) -> {
      int size = 0;
      if (repos != null) {
        size = repos.size();
      }
      Log.d("Activity", "list: " + size + "");
      showEmptyList(size == 0);
      adapter.submitList(repos);
    });
```

## 5. Define the source of data for the paged list

The `PagedList` loads content dynamically from a source. In our case, because the database is the 
main source of truth for the UI, it also represents the source for the `PagedList`. If your app gets
data directly from the network and displays it without caching, then the class that makes network 
requests would be your data source.

A source is defined by a [DataSource] class. To page in data from a source that can change—such as a
source that allows inserting, deleting or updating data—you will also need to implement a 
`DataSource.Factory` that knows how to create the `DataSource`. Whenever the data set is updated,
the `DataSource` is invalidated and re-created automatically through the `DataSource.Factory`.

The Room persistence library provides native support for data sources associated with the `Paging`
library. For a given query, Room allows you to return a `DataSource.Factory` from the DAO and 
handles the implementation of the `DataSource` for you.

**Update the code to get a `DataSource.Factory` from Room:**

 * `RepoDao`: update the `reposByName()` function to return a `DataSource.Factory<Int, Repo>`.
   ```java
   DataSource.Factory<Integer, Repo> reposByName(String queryString)
   ```
 * `GithubLocalCache` uses this function. Change the return type of `reposByName` function to be
   `DataSource.Factory<Integer, Repo>`.
